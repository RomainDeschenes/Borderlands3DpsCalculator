# Borderlands3WeaponDpsCalculator
An Android App for Borderlands 3 weapons DPS calculation
**Now works with Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel!**

When you try to use auto scan for the first time it will ask permission and you will get a black screen where the camera should be, just back out and press the auto scan button again.

This App allows you to enter a weapon's stats and the app will display stats (including DPS) about your weapon. 
There's also an automatic scan feature that uses your phone's camera to automatically fill the weapon's info for you. 
The intended use is to be able to quickly look weapons in your inventory and figure out if one is better than another.

Bear in mind that there's a lot of things this app doesn't do that you might want to take into account when comparing :

- Synergy with your character
- Element of the weapon and the elemental damage over time.
- Weapons that uses multiple ammo per shot (you can simulate that by reducing the magazine size by 2 if you weapon uses 2 ammo per shot for example)
- Crit damage
- Tediore reloading damage
- Alternates mode (auto, semi-auto, burst ...)
